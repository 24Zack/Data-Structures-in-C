# Data Structures and Algorithm in C

# Description

This project provides a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in the C programming language, as well as different sorting algorithms and the basic of strings and files that were introduced beforehand.

# Prerequisites
To effectively learn and work with data structures in C, you need to have a solid understanding of several foundational concepts such as the basics of C programming, pointers and arrays as well as strings (although they are reviewed in the documents). 

## How to download and clone this project
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/24Zack/Data-Structures-in-C

```

## How to run C code

#### Make sure you installed GNU C++ compiler

```bash
   gcc --v
```
#### If not install write in your terminal (for macs)

```bash
   brew install gcc
```
#### Generate the executable file (.exe for Windows or .out for macs)

```bash
  gcc file_name.c -o executable_file_name
```

#### Run the file

```bash
  ./executable_file_name
```
