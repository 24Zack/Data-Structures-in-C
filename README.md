# Data Structures and Algorithm in C

# Description

This project provides a collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in the C programming language, the project consits of three parts : the exercises, the homeworks and the projects I had to do. In the exercises, you can find each exercise instruction in the comment above of the file, as well as its solution below the comment (I highly encourage you to do them). The homeworks also are designed in the same way. There are two projects also provided, one implemented using circular queues, and the other using heaps.

# Prerequisites
To understand data structures in C, you shall have solid foundations in programming in general, but the most important thing is to understand the basics of C programming (which makes C programming unique) which are pointers, arrays and strings.

# Content

7. Recursion
    - Merge sort
8. Trees 
    - Binary search trees (BST)
    - AVL trees
9. Heaps
    -  Minimum heap
    -  Maximum heap
    -  Heapsort
10. Hash tables
    - Linear Probing
    - Quadratic Probing
    - Double Hashing
11. Graphs
    - Minimum Spanning tree (MST, using Prim's algorithm)
    - DFS: depth first search
    - BFS: breadth first search
    - Dijkstra's algorithm 

## How to download and clone this project
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/24Zack/Data-Structures-in-C

```
## How to run C code

#### Make sure you installed GNU C++ compiler

```bash
   gcc --v
```
#### If not install write in your terminal (for macs)

```bash
   brew install gcc
```
#### Generate the executable file (.exe for Windows or .out for macs)

```bash
  gcc file_name.c -o executable_file_name
```

#### Run the file

```bash
  ./executable_file_name
```
